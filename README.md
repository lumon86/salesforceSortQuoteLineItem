# salesforceSortQuoteLineItem
A simple lightning component to sort Quote Line items 

I share this code to sort Quote Line items until salesforce release the lighgnting function to sort the items. 
Just copy and paste the code in your components and create a class with the name: cmpCtrlSortProducts
And here you will find the component controller, helper and cmp.
